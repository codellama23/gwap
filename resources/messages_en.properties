Today, these reproductions exist in substantial electronic repositories certainly amounting to several millions items. What can we do to retrieve these reproductions preferably on the basis of various criteria? As the possibilities of a computerized search of these reproductions are still very limited we allocate keywords, known as metadata. This is a most time-consuming operation and one would need a great number of staff members to do this job. We would appreciate your contribution to this game. However, we don't only want something from you but we offer you as well entertainment and at the same time training as you get to know quite a lot about the paintings shown here. In addition to that, you will be able to work with the descriptions you gave us.</p><h2>Image portfolio</h2><p>The underlying image portfolio is retained from the Artemis database, which was assembled at the <a href\="http\://www.kunstgeschichte.uni-muenchen.de/" target\="_blank">Institute for Art History</a> at the <a href\="http\://www.uni-muenchen.de/" target\="_blank">University of Munich</a> in cooperation with the <a href\="http\://www.itg.uni-muenchen.de/" target\="_blank">IT-Group Humanities</a> and now contains more than 25.000&nbsp;images.</p><h2>Project funding</h2><p>The project is funded by the <a href\="http\://www.dfg.de" target\="_blank">German Research Foundation (DFG)<img src\="img/logo-dfg.png" style\="float\:right"/></a></p><p>More information about ARTigo can be found at the <a href\="http\://www.play4science.org" target\="_blank">Play4Science project</a> as well as in our <a href\="http\://blog.play4science.org" target\="_blank">blog</a>.</p><p>You can also reach us per email at <span class\="spamspan"><span class\="u">artigo</span> [at] <span class\="d">artigo [dot] org</span></span></p>

description.manual.artigo.text                              = <p>ARTigo is an online game with the aim to supply artworks with tags. The same artwork is simultaneously shown to you and a co-player. The game now consists in describing the artwork accurately with tags. A tag can describe what you see on the artwork or remarks on style, quality or emotions. For each artwork, you have 60 seconds for your input. You get points for the tags identical to the ones entered by your co-player or another player in a previous round. The more tags per artwork are matched, the more points you get during the five rounds of the game. Every entered tag is saved and improves the search for artworks. As for the search however, only those tags entered at least twice for an artwork and thus marked in blue are relevant.</p><p>On the left side of the artwork you see the tags you already entered. According to the points, some are marked in different colours\:<ul><li>Black tags have never been entered before for this artwork. You don't get any points.</li><li>Dark blue tags were entered by your co-player in this round. Both of you get 25 points.</li><li>Light blue tags have been entered for this artwork in previous games. You get 5 points.</li></ul></p><p>As to the taboo game, some taboo words are indicated additionally. You cannot use them for the description of the artwork because they had already been verified.</p><p>After five rounds you can review the artworks with additional information. Title, artist, location and date of origin are displayed.</p>

In Karido one of the two players describes while the other one makes guesses.</p><p>At first, the describer chooses one of the nine artworks and tags it as in ARTigo. At the same time, while looking at the tags, the guesser tries to find out which of the artworks is meant. The more the shown artworks are alike, the more difficult it is to find characteristic tags in order to define the differences. At all times, the guesser can ask the describer questions in form of tags. The answer can be \u201Cyes\u201D or \u201Cno\u201D.</p><p>As soon as the guesser chose the correct artwork, the describer chooses a new one from the remaining artworks and describes it. He does so until all artworks are guessed.</p><p>You can play Karido either limited by a determined time or by the number of turns. As regards the version with a time limit you have 90 seconds to recognize as many artworks as possible with the help of tags. When choosing the turn-based version, there is no time limit but only 30 moves per round are allowed.</p>
